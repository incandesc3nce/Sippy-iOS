# Sippy - find your buddy for partying

Sippy is a social platform designed for individuals seeking like-minded companions for social gatherings and parties. 
It features an interactive map showcasing both scheduled and ongoing events. Users can apply to attend these events, 
securing a spot on the guest list, or create their own events and invite others to join.

Sippy's MVP was done in 48 hours during a 10th Barnaul Hackathon (2024).
